  <h1>Megan's Background</h1>
</div>
  <p>I was born and raised in <em>Reno, Nevada</em>.  After college, I began working at a court reporting firm.  I moved to Oregon with my husband, and worked at TV stations in Portland before going back to the court reporting world.</p>
  <p>Although I <strong>love</strong> the legal field, I want to move into a better career.  I'm taking this class both to learn a new skill, and to hopefully move into a new industry</p>
